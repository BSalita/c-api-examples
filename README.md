# c-api-examples
Visual Studio 2015 solution for building WebAssembly/binaryen/test/examples/binaryen-c files. The solution will build binaryen-c.cpp into a static library. The library can then be used by the examples c-api-hello-world.c and c-api-kitchen-sink.cpp.

To use, clone WebAssembly/binaryen. Be sure to edit all this repos project files (.vcxproj) to path at the source files in the binaryen cloned directory.
